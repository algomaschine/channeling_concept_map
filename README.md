# Channeling Concept Map

This is an attempt to combine all the ideas of channeling entities and their concepts into one graph to see the intersection of meanings.

## Prepare Environment

I use Python 3.10.14. To install the necessary packages, run:

```bash
pip install pyvis networkx matplotlib
How to Update the Graph
To add more entities and meanings, use the entities.json and idea_definitions.json files. The format is straightforward.

Setup Python Environment with Conda
This guide will walk you through the steps to create a Conda environment for Python 3.10.14 and install the necessary packages (pyvis, networkx, and matplotlib). Instructions are provided for both Linux and Windows systems.

Prerequisites
Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system.
Step 1: Create Conda Environment
First, create a new Conda environment with Python 3.10.14.

Linux and macOS
Open a terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
conda create --name myenv python=3.10.14
Windows
Open the Anaconda Prompt and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
conda create --name myenv python=3.10.14
Replace myenv with your preferred environment name.

Step 2: Activate the Conda Environment
To activate the Conda environment, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
conda activate myenv
Step 3: Install Required Packages
Once the environment is activated, install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
conda install -c conda-forge pyvis networkx matplotlib
This command will install the required packages from the conda-forge channel.
